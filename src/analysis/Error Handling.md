# Error Handling

### API returns error
- ~~Intercept the response for api failure // if we go with this, won't be able to handle it specifically~~
- ~~Call `messageService` from error block~~
- Automatically reload the state after login
- ~~Can subscribe like we did for category solve the issue?~~
- may have to check for the subscribe/unsubscribe on other pages as well
